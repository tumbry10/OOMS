 My level 2 Project, Online Ordering System for Lobels
System Consists of 3 types of users (SystemAdmin, SalesRep & Customer)
All Users use the same login page, & upon login they are redirected to different pages with respect to their user types
Admin can add Admin from add_admin page (But the added admin not yet given full rights, like is_staff and is_superuser)
Admin can add Sales Rep from the add_staff page successfully
